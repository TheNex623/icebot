How to make Proper Build

macOS:
- npm run dist:mac

------------------------------

Windows:
- npm run dist:win
- cp LICENSE ./dist/win-unpacked
- node scripts/installer.js


If you get an error that says

Failed with exit code: 1
Output:
Attempting to build package from 'icebot-shopify.nuspec'.
File not found: 'icebot-shopify.exe'.

when building the Windows version then go into /dist/win-unpacked directory and rename IceBot.exe to icebot-shopify.exe
then run "node scripts/installer.js" again
